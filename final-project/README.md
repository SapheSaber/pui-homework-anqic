## Feedback Summary
The portfolio site was praised for its dynamic feature of text appearing as the user scrolls, and the addition of a light and dark mode was recognized as a good way to showcase coding skills. For the personal finance site, peers appreciated the sidebar for its navigation and organizational clarity. They also suggested incorporating video tutorials to enhance its educational value and highlighted that the use of visuals would make complex information more digestible. For the ice-cream shop site, the interactive homepage feature, which changes images based on flavors, was well-received. However, peers noted that including recipes seemed somewhat out of place. They also recommended embedding Google reviews for each shop and suggested adding a tracker to show which pages the user has visited.

## Feedback Digestion
After reviewing the feedback, I have decided to proceed with the personal finance website, as it aligns most closely with my interests and goals. The positive feedback on the sidebar navigation reinforced the idea of maintaining a clear information structure, which will remain a key design element. I will also incorporate video tutorials, as suggested by my peers, to make the site more educational and engaging for users. Additionally, Iâ€™ll also consider the feedback of focusing on using visuals to present financial information in a more accessible and less overwhelming way.
